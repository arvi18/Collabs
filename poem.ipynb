              "(#100) ['A Ballad of Burdens\\nThe burden of fair women. Vain delight,\\nAnd love self-slain in some sweet shameful way,\\nAnd sorrowful old age that comes by night\\nAs a thief comes that has no heart by day,\\nAnd change that finds fair cheeks and leaves them grey,\\nAnd weariness that keeps awake for hire,\\nAnd grief that says what pleasure used to say;\\nThis is the end of every man\\'s desire.\\nThe burden of bought kisses. This is sore,\\nA burden without fruit in childbearing;\\nBetween the nightfall and the dawn threescore,\\nThreescore between the dawn and evening.\\nThe shuddering in thy lips, the shuddering\\nIn thy sad eyelids tremulous like fire,\\nMakes love seem shameful and a wretched thing.\\nThis is the end of every man\\'s desire.\\nThe burden of sweet speeches. Nay, kneel down,\\nCover thy head, and weep; for verily\\nThese market-men that buy thy white and brown\\nIn the last days shall take no thought for thee.\\nIn the last days like earth thy face shall be,\\nYea, like sea-marsh made thick with brine and mire,\\nSad with sick leavings of the sterile sea.\\nThis is the end of every man\\'s desire.\\nThe burden of long living. Thou shalt fear\\nWaking, and sleeping mourn upon thy bed;\\nAnd say at night \"Would God the day were here,\"\\nAnd say at dawn \"Would God the day were dead.\"\\nWith weary days thou shalt be clothed and fed,\\nAnd wear remorse of heart for thine attire,\\nPain for thy girdle and sorrow upon thine head;\\nThis is the end of every man\\'s desire.\\nThe burden of bright colours. Thou shalt see\\nGold tarnished, and the grey above the green;\\nAnd as the thing thou seest thy face shall be,\\nAnd no more as the thing beforetime seen.\\nAnd thou shalt say of mercy \"It hath been,\"\\nAnd living, watch the old lips and loves expire,\\nAnd talking, tears shall take thy breath between;\\nThis is the end of every man\\'s desire.\\nThe burden of sad sayings. In that day\\nThou shalt tell all thy days and hours, and tell\\nThy times and ways and words of love, and say\\nHow one was dear and one desirable,\\nAnd sweet was life to hear and sweet to smell,\\nBut now with lights reverse the old hours retire\\nAnd the last hour is shod with fire from hell;\\nThis is the end of every man\\'s desire.\\nThe burden of four seasons. Rain in spring,\\nWhite rain and wind among the tender trees;\\nA summer of green sorrows gathering,\\nRank autumn in a mist of miseries,\\nWith sad face set towards the year, that sees\\nThe charred ash drop out of the dropping pyre,\\nAnd winter wan with many maladies;\\nThis is the end of every man\\'s desire.\\nThe burden of dead faces. Out of sight\\nAnd out of love, beyond the reach of hands,\\nChanged in the changing of the dark and light,\\nThey walk and weep about the barren lands\\nWhere no seed is nor any garner stands,\\nWhere in short breaths the doubtful days respire,\\nAnd time\\'s turned glass lets through the sighing sands;\\nThis is the end of every man\\'s desire.\\nThe burden of much gladness. Life and lust\\nForsake thee, and the face of thy delight;\\nAnd underfoot the heavy hour strews dust,\\nAnd overhead strange weathers burn and bite;\\nAnd where the red was, lo the bloodless white,\\nAnd where the truth was, the likeness of a liar,\\nAnd where the day was, the likeness of the night;\\nThis is the end of every man\\'s desire.\\nL\\'ENVOY\\nPrinces, and ye whom pleasure quickeneth,\\nHeed well this rhyme before your pleasure tire;\\nFor life is sweet, but after life is death.\\nThis is the end of every man\\'s desire.','Some words are bullets\\nsome mouths resemble barrels\\ncertain tongues triggers','The burden of hard hitting. Slug away\\nLike Honus Wagner or like Tyrus Cobb.\\nElse fandom shouteth: \"Who said you could play?\\nBack to the jasper league, you minor slob!\"\\nSwat, hit, connect, line out, goet on the job.\\nElse you shall feel the brunt of fandom\\'s ire\\nBiff, bang it, clout it, hit it on the knob -\\nThis is the end of every fan\\'s desire.\\nThe burden of good pitching. Curved or straight.\\nOr in or out, or haply up or down,\\nTo puzzle him that standeth by the plate,\\nTo lessen, so to speak, his bat-renown:\\nLike Christy Mathewson or Miner Brown,\\nSo pitch that every man can but admire\\nAnd offer you the freedom of the town -\\nThis is the end of every fan\\'s desire.\\nThe burden of loud cheering. O the sounds!\\nThe tumult and the shouting from the throats\\nOf forty thousand at the Polo Grounds\\nSitting, ay, standing sans their hats and coats.\\nA mighty cheer that possibly denotes\\nThat Cub or Pirate fat is in the fire;\\nOr, as H. James would say, We\\'ve got their goats -\\nThis is the end of every fan\\'s desire.\\nThe burden of a pennant. O the hope,\\nThe tenuous hope, the hope that\\'s half a fear,\\nThe lengthy season and the boundless dope,\\nAnd the bromidic, \"Wait until next year.\"\\nO dread disgrace of trailing in the rear,\\nO Piece of Bunting, flying high and higher\\nThat next October it shall flutter here:\\nThis is the end of every fan\\'s desire.\\nENVOY\\nAh, Fans, let not the Quarry but the Chase\\nBe that to which most fondly we aspire!\\nFor us not Stake, but Game; not Goal, but Race -\\nTHIS is the end of every fan\\'s desire.','If down here I chance to die,\\nSolemnly I beg you take\\nAll that is left of \"I\"\\nTo the Hills for old sake\\'s sake,\\nPack me very thoroughly\\nIn the ice that used to slake\\nPegs I drank when I was dry --\\nThis observe for old sake\\'s sake.\\nTo the railway station hie,\\nThere a single ticket take\\nFor Umballa -- goods-train -- I\\nShall not mind delay or shake.\\nI shall rest contentedly\\nSpite of clamor coolies make;\\nThus in state and dignity\\nSend me up for old sake\\'s sake.\\nNext the sleepy Babu wake,\\nBook a Kalka van \"for four.\"\\nFew, I think, will care to make\\nJourneys with me any more\\nAs they used to do of yore.\\nI shall need a \"special\" break --\\nThing I never took before --\\nGet me one for old sake\\'s sake.\\nAfter that -- arrangements make.\\nNo hotel will take me in,\\nAnd a bullock\\'s back would break\\n\\'Neath the teak and leaden skin\\nTonga ropes are frail and thin,\\nOr, did I a back-seat take,\\nIn a tonga I might spin, --\\nDo your best for old sake\\'s sake.\\nAfter that -- your work is done.\\nRecollect a Padre must\\nMourn the dear departed one --\\nThrow the ashes and the dust.\\nDon\\'t go down at once.
